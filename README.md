# java-Client

This is the GUI client of the java server. It basically lets you connect to the server via the IP address you put in.
It lets you view the files hosted on the server and also lets you download as well as upload to and from the server.

Bugs:
----

The jScrollPane does not work right now at the linked list.
File Names with two or more words are not accepted.

Though the coding conventions are really poor, I'd appreciate any contribution to the program!
